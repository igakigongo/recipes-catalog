## Catalog of Recipes

### Introduction
The web application has 2 pages, `a  recipes list view` and `a recipe details view`. On the recipes list view we have listed several recipes, from which you can choose. Once you choose a recipe, its details are revealed on a new web page/view. 

The recipes listed can also be filtered by the ingredients.

We list as much information as we can about the recipe as we can, such as
  * Nutritional Information
  * Visualized Ingredients
  * e.t.c
